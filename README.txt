Circle-themed topdown 2D dota-like

When two halves of a whole collide, they form Binaries... These Binaries challenge each other in hopes of becoming the whole. Players on each side battle to push forth their Binary, and dominate the other.
As Binaries collide, they form dark solids called Walls, and creatures called Deviations within the center. Walls are impassable solid matter. Deviations, if defeated, will empower their victor's side.

Players themselves take the form of small circles, and at the start of the game have:
	-5 hp (shown neatly along a player's circle as a segment)
	-Left-click: dash towards the cursor, dealing 1dmg to an enemy
	-Right-click: move towards the cursor at 10degrees per second
	-(180 / X) Power to spend at the spawn (X = team_size)
	-Gain 1 Power every X seconds (X = team_size)
	-1hps after 5 seconds of inaction

At the far side of each Binary are the players' spawns, where they gain 1hps. If a player dies, they immediately respawn at their base with 1 hp. While at the base, players can spend Power they've earned to enhance their abilities or upgrade stats.
